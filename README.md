The goal of the project is to build a simple multi screen app is to presents relevant information to a user whoâ€™s visiting your city. The app contains several lists of relevant attractions for the location. The User is able to navigate between them with tabs via fragments.

App uses custom adapter to populate the layouts with the. Multidimensional assets etc
